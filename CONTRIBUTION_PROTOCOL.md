# PURAIFY Contribution Protocol

This document defines the required standards for contributing code and documentation to the PURAIFY system ‚Äî either by human developers or automated agents (such as Codux or GPT).

The goal is to maintain a consistent, traceable, and fully documented codebase that is always in sync with its implementation state.

---

## üß† Purpose

PURAIFY is a modular, multi-engine system. For this reason, **every code change must include proper documentation updates** ‚Äî across system-level and engine-specific files.

This ensures the system is:
- Understandable to AI agents (e.g., Codux)
- Traceable by contributors
- Expandable without chaos
- Aligned with its own blueprint principles

---

## ‚úÖ Mandatory Actions for Every Contribution

Every time you:
- Add a file, endpoint, engine, or integration
- Remove or rename a file
- Change engine behavior
- Extend system capabilities

You **must update the following files**:

---

### 1. `README.md` (Root)

- Add/Update entries in the **üìÅ Project Structure** section
- Update the engine list in **‚öôÔ∏è Core Engines** (add/remove/change status)
- Reflect new or removed components clearly

---

### 2. `SYSTEM_STATE.md`

This file reflects the current operational snapshot of PURAIFY.

Update it to:
- Add new engines or mark progress (‚úÖ / üü° / üî≤)
- Add new endpoints
- Show current status (e.g., ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù, ‚Äúready‚Äù, ‚Äúconnected to gateway‚Äù)
- Track live capabilities

---

### 3. The relevant engine‚Äôs `README.md`

If you touch a specific engine:
- Add the new route to the API documentation
- Update its capabilities and responsibilities
- Clarify integration points if modified

---

### 4. Optional: Add to `CHANGELOG.md` (future)

You may log versioned changes here for long-term releases.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Format Guidelines

- All documentation must be written in clear English.
- Use consistent Markdown headers and formatting (e.g., `##`, tables, code blocks).
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes.
- Use examples (inputs/outputs) when defining new endpoints.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Violations

Changes that do not follow this protocol will be flagged and rejected ‚Äî whether by human reviewers or future CI checks.

This protocol is required for all code merges, pull requests, or AI-generated changes.

---

## ü§ñ Codux/GPT Integration

When working with Codux or similar systems:
- Start each prompt with:  
  `Please follow the PURAIFY Contribution Protocol.`  
- Make sure to instruct Codux to **update all documentation** as part of the request.
- Ensure `README.md`, `SYSTEM_STATE.md`, and engine docs reflect changes accurately.

---

## ‚úÖ Example: Adding a new action to Execution Engine

If you add a new action called `send_email` to Execution:
- Add its route + input/output to `execution/README.md`
- Add a status line in `SYSTEM_STATE.md` under Execution
- Confirm `execution/src/index.ts` exists and is mapped in root `README.md`

## üß≠ Summary

| What You Did                     | Must Update                            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Added a new engine               | Root `README.md`, `SYSTEM_STATE.md`    |
| Added endpoint to engine         | Engine‚Äôs `README.md`, `SYSTEM_STATE.md`|
| Changed how Gateway routes       | Gateway `README.md`, `README.md`       |
| Added feature across multiple engines | All relevant engine docs + root files |

Keep PURAIFY structured.  
Make it understandable by humans *and* machines.  
Build like the system builds itself.
