## TODO
- [x] Create ENGINE_DEPENDENCIES.md
- [x] Create NAMESPACE_MAP.md
- [x] Define standard codex-todo format across engines
- [x] Populate ENGINES_INDEX.md with current engines and statuses
- [x] Expand ENGINE_DEPENDENCIES.md for Platform Builder, Execution, and Gateway
- [x] Flesh out NAMESPACE_MAP.md with real modules and routes
- [x] Provide initial docker-compose.yml or document missing services
- [x] Add test folders and `npm test` scripts for each engine per CONTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL.md

- [x] Document gateway's `codex-todo.md` in both root README and gateway README
- [ ] Create integration tests that run blueprint creation via Gateway and execute actions üåê External constraint (npm install blocked)
- [ ] Review ENGINE_DEPENDENCIES.md for accuracy against code implementation

## Proposed Actions
**Log proposed environment updates here.** Each entry should include:
- Description and rationale
- Expected impact
- Status: Proposed / Approved / Executed
- Date and approver when resolved

Refer to `PROPOSED_ACTIONS_LOG.md` for the historical record.

- [PA1] Establish a standard format guide for `codex-todo.md` files across engines. Rationale: ensure consistency for automated parsing. Impact: documentation only. **Status: Executed**
- [PA2] Populate `docker-compose.yml` with services for each engine to simplify local development. Impact: easier startup. **Status: Executed**
- [PA3] Add minimal test infrastructure using Node's built-in test runner with `ts-node` loader. Impact: enable basic CI testing. **Status: Executed**
- [PA4] Introduce shared `.env` files for service URLs across engines. Impact: simplified configuration. **Status: Proposed**
