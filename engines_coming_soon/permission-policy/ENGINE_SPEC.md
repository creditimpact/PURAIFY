# 🧠 Engine Spec: Permission & Policy Engine

## 🎯 Purpose

The Permission & Policy Engine governs who can do what within user-generated platforms.  
It provides a structured and secure way to manage roles, permissions, and context-aware policies — ensuring that only authorized users perform critical actions under the right conditions.

It supports both RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control), and prevents unsafe or unauthorized behavior at runtime.

## ⚙️ Core Responsibilities

| Area                   | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🛡️ Authorization Logic | Enforces permissions using RBAC and ABAC rules                    |
| 👥 Role Management      | Defines and resolves roles like Admin, Editor, Viewer             |
| 📜 Policy Evaluation    | Evaluates dynamic rules based on context (e.g., time, IP)         |
| 🚫 Action Restriction   | Prevents unsafe actions (e.g., mass delete, prod deploy)          |
| 🔄 Contextual Decisions | Supports real-time context-sensitive rules                        |

---

## 🚫 What It Does NOT Do

- ❌ Does not execute actions — Execution Engine handles that  
- ❌ Does not store or serve API tokens — Vault Engine is responsible  
- ❌ Does not override central decisions — final authority remains with Engine Control Core

## 🔗 Engine Integrations

| Engine           | Role                                                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Execution Engine | Checks if user can perform action (e.g., send Slack)                   |
| Platform Builder | Sets roles/permissions during platform creation                        |
| Engine Control   | Receives and logs final authorization outcomes                         |
| Vault Engine     | Prevents token access if user lacks rights                              |
| Feedback Loop    | Invoked when an action is blocked or escalated                         |

## 📥 Input Example – Access Check

```json
{
  "user_id": "user-789",
  "project_id": "pf-456",
  "requested_action": "delete_database",
  "context": {
    "time": "23:12",
    "ip": "42.198.1.22",
    "role": "builder"
  }
}
```

## 📤 Output Example – Decision

```json
{
  "action_allowed": false,
  "reason": "Only Admins can delete databases after 22:00",
  "severity": "critical",
  "alternatives": ["backup_database"]
}
```

## 🧱 Internal Architecture

| Component              | Description                                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Role Definition Module | Maps users to roles at project/system level                         |
| Scope Engine           | Defines allowed actions per role                                     |
| Context Evaluator      | Applies ABAC logic (time, IP, env, etc.)                             |
| Policy Rule Builder    | Creates rules like “Clients can't deploy to production”              |
| Access Decision Engine | Returns allow/block decisions per request                            |

## 🔄 Flow Example

**Input:**

```json
{
  "user_id": "user_777",
  "project_id": "pf_123",
  "action": "deploy",
  "env": "production"
}
```

**Process:**

1. Resolve user's role in the project (Editor)  
2. Load permitted actions for that role and environment  
3. Evaluate conditional rules and policy overrides  
4. Return decision with reason and next steps  

**Output:**

```json
{
  "allowed": false,
  "reason": "Editors cannot deploy to production",
  "required_permission": "admin"
}
```

## 🧩 UI & User Interaction Scenarios

| Scenario              | User Experience                                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Action blocked        | Clear message with reason + escalation options                |
| Role management       | Admin defines roles and scopes                                |
| Permissions matrix    | Grid view by user/project/action                              |
| Conditional rule config | E.g., “Allow access only on weekdays”                      |

## 🧠 Summary

The Permission & Policy Engine is the gatekeeper of PURAIFY.  
It ensures that only authorized users perform sensitive actions — based on role, context, and custom rules.  

It brings order, safety, and flexibility to every platform users create — without writing a single line of policy code.
