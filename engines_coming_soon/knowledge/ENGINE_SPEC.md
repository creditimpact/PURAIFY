# 🧠 Engine Spec: Knowledge Engine

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Knowledge Engine is responsible for **understanding and formalizing** the platform the user has built.  
It receives structured input from the Platform Builder (UI components, fields, logic, integrations) and produces a **cohesive, canonical Blueprint**.  

This Blueprint becomes the technical representation of the platform — consumed by validation, execution, documentation, and deployment engines.

It is the internal “X-ray” system of PURAIFY — always up to date, queryable, and versioned.

## ⚙️ Core Responsibilities

| Action                  | Description                                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 📥 Receive Platform Input | Accepts structured data from Builder or Composer         |
| 🧠 Structure Analysis     | Identifies entities, fields, logic, views, and integrations |
| 🧩 Blueprint Assembly     | Builds a normalized, machine-readable platform definition |
| 🔄 Smart Completion      | Fills missing data via rules or AI assistance            |
| 🧾 Persistent Storage     | Stores versioned blueprints in a dedicated Knowledge Store |
| 🔍 Query Exposure         | Allows other engines to fetch definitions or partial slices |

## 🚫 What It Does NOT Do

- ❌ Does not validate schema correctness → that's the Validation Engine  
- ❌ Does not generate new UI or flows → it describes, not builds  
- ❌ Does not execute → execution is delegated to Execution Engine  

## 🔗 Engine Integrations

| Engine              | Role                                                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Platform Builder     | Supplies structured user-created platform data             |
| Validation Engine    | Uses blueprint for schema conformity checks                |
| Execution Engine     | Uses blueprint to know what actions are valid              |
| Project Composer     | Extends or modifies platforms based on existing blueprints |
| Feedback Loop Engine | Requests clarification for missing blueprint parts         |
| Documentation Engine | Reads blueprint to auto-generate human-readable docs       |

## 📥 Input Example

```json
{
  "project_id": "pf_001",
  "platform_name": "LeadsBoard",
  "ui": {
    "views": ["kanban", "table"],
    "fields": ["name", "status", "email"]
  },
  "logic_rules": [
    { "if": "status == hot", "then": "send_slack_message" }
  ],
  "integrations": ["Slack", "Notion"]
}
```

## 📤 Output Example – Blueprint

```json
{
  "project_id": "pf_001",
  "type": "Task Management",
  "entities": ["lead"],
  "fields": ["name", "status", "email"],
  "logic": [
    {
      "trigger": "status == hot",
      "action": "send_slack_message"
    }
  ],
  "integrations": ["Slack", "Notion"],
  "views": ["kanban", "table"]
}
```

## 🔄 Internal Flow

1. Input received from Builder / Composer  
2. Blueprint Builder parses entities, rules, and components  
3. Schema Mapper standardizes UI, logic, data into blueprint format  
4. Result stored in the Knowledge Store with version metadata  
5. Any change triggers Diff Tracker for traceability  
6. Other engines can query full or partial blueprints  

## 🧱 Internal Architecture

| Component            | Responsibility                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blueprint Builder     | Converts raw platform structure into normalized JSON          |
| Schema Mapper         | Unifies fields, views, logic and maps to internal format      |
| Knowledge Store       | Persists all blueprints with version control                  |
| Diff & Change Tracker | Detects and stores changes across blueprint versions          |
| Query API             | Exposes platform structure to other engines securely          |

## 🌐 External Dependencies

| Service               | Purpose                                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Vault Engine           | Resolves service names or schema secrets if needed     |
| AI Interaction Layer   | Optionally clarifies or completes missing platform logic |
| Monitoring Engine      | Logs significant changes in platform definitions       |

## 🧪 Use Cases

| Scenario                     | Output                                       |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| User builds platform via UI  | Knowledge Engine stores full blueprint       |
| System needs to validate flows | Validation Engine fetches from Knowledge    |
| User asks “What does this do?” | Documentation Generator extracts logic     |
| Composer clones a project     | Blueprint copied and remapped               |

## 🧭 Summary

The Knowledge Engine is the central modeler of PURAIFY.  
It transforms user-built logic and UI into a technical blueprint-of-record — used by every other engine in the system.  
It doesn’t validate, execute, or decide — it simply describes.  

This engine ensures that all logic, data, UI and flow structure are available as one cohesive source of truth.
