# 🧠 Engine Spec: Platform Builder (Studio)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The Platform Builder is the **visual editor** where users build complete platforms **without code**.

Through an intuitive UI, users define:
- Entities and fields (data structure)
- Business logic (rules, triggers, conditions)
- UI layouts (forms, views)
- Integrations (Slack, Notion, etc.)

The output is a **Blueprint** that defines how the system should behave — but is not yet running logic.  
Think of it as the “studio” or “IDE” for platform creators.

## ⚙️ Core Responsibilities

| Action               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| 🎨 Visual UI Builder | Drag & Drop interface for building forms, views, logic |
| ⚙️ Logic Definition   | Rule editor (If/Then, conditionals, multi-step) |
| 🧱 Data Model Design  | Define entities, fields, and relationships |
| 🔌 Integration Setup  | Select and configure services like Slack, Notion |
| 🧪 Live Preview       | Show how the platform behaves in real-time |
| 💾 Sync to Knowledge Engine | Every change is persisted to Blueprint storage |

---

## 🚫 What It Does *NOT* Do

- ❌ Does **not** execute actions (Execution Engine handles that)
- ❌ Does **not** validate structures (Validation Engine handles that)
- ❌ Does **not** interpret blueprints (Knowledge Engine handles that)

---

## 🌐 API Endpoint

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `POST` | `/builder/create` | Generate a Blueprint from a user prompt |

---

## 🔗 Engine Integrations

| Engine                | Role |
|-----------------------|------|
| Knowledge Engine      | Stores the final Blueprint definition |
| Validation Engine     | Performs live validation of the structure |
| Execution Engine      | Executes logic flows created here |
| Integration Manager   | Provides integration info and scopes |
| AI Interaction Layer  | Allows conversational building (“create a meetings system”) |
| Project Composer      | Completes missing components in the structure |
| Feedback Loop         | Displays issues, suggestions, or confirmations to the user |

---

## 📥 Input Example

```json
{
  "user_id": "u_101",
  "platform_name": "LeadsFlow",
  "entities": ["lead", "agent"],
  "fields": ["name", "email", "status"],
  "logic_rules": [
    { "if": "status == hot", "then": "send_slack_message" }
  ],
  "integrations": ["Slack", "Notion"],
  "ui_layout": {
    "type": "kanban",
    "group_by": "status"
  }
}
```

## 📝 Blueprint Schema

```ts
interface BlueprintAction {
  type: string;
  params?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface Blueprint {
  trigger: { type: string };
  actions: BlueprintAction[];
}

interface BlueprintResponse {
  project: string;
  blueprint: Blueprint;
}
```

---

## 📤 Output Example – Final Blueprint

```json
{
  "project_id": "pf_456",
  "blueprint_source": "studio",
  "structure": {
    "entities": ["lead", "agent"],
    "fields": ["name", "email", "status"],
    "relations": [],
    "logic": [
      {
        "trigger": "status == hot",
        "action": "send_slack_message",
        "target": "#sales"
      }
    ],
    "ui": {
      "layout": "kanban",
      "group_by": "status"
    }
  },
  "version": "v1.0",
  "created_by": "user_101"
}
```

---

## 🔄 Typical Flow

1. User adds a new form and defines fields (`name`, `email`, etc.)
2. Builds a logic flow: “When status is hot → Send Slack message”
3. Builder checks Slack integration via Integration Manager
4. Entire structure is saved as a Blueprint to Knowledge Engine
5. Validation Engine verifies structure integrity (e.g., required fields, logic correctness)
6. Feedback Loop surfaces warnings, suggestions, or confirmations
7. Preview Renderer shows live platform behavior

## 👥 User Interactions

| Scenario                 | Example |
|--------------------------|---------|
| Drag & Drop Components   | Build visual forms, views, and layouts |
| Logic Flow Building      | “If user clicks button → Send Slack message” |
| Integration Selection    | Choose Slack, Notion, Gmail, etc. |
| AI-Powered Suggestions   | “Would you like to notify the client too?” |
| Live Preview             | Simulated behavior inside builder canvas |

---


## 📌 Key Notes

- Every change is live-synced and versioned
- Full undo/redo support
- Supports collaborative editing and templates
- Can be driven via Codux API
- Fully responsive and UX-optimized

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Template marketplace
- Real-time co-building (multiple users)
- In-app assistant for suggestions
- More preview modes (mobile, tablet, dark mode)

## 🧠 Summary

The Platform Builder is where every PURAIFY project begins.  
It allows any user to turn ideas into functional platforms — visually and without writing code.  
Every engine in the system relies on what’s built here — so clarity, sync, and structure are mission-critical.
