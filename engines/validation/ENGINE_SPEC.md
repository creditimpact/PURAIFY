# 🧠 Engine Spec: Validation Engine

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Ensure that blueprints generated by the Platform Builder or edited by users are syntactically valid before execution. It performs structural checks and will eventually enforce permission and policy constraints.

## ⚙️ Core Responsibilities

| Action                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| ✅ Validate Blueprint     | Confirm required fields exist and are correctly typed |
| ❌ Authorize Execution    | Delegated to Engine Control |
| ❌ Modify Blueprints      | Out of scope — builder handles updates |

## 🔗 Engine Integrations

| Engine            | Role |
|-------------------|------|
| Platform Builder  | Provides blueprints to validate |
| Execution Engine  | Optional dry-run to check action feasibility |
| Vault Engine      | May verify tokens exist when referenced |

## 🧪 Input Example

```json
{
  "blueprint": {
    "actions": [
      { "type": "log_message", "params": { "message": "hi" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## 📤 Output Example

```json
{ "valid": true }
```

## 🧠 Summary

The Validation Engine provides a safety net between blueprint creation and execution. It will grow to cover schema enforcement and integration checks as PURAIFY expands.
