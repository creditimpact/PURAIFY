# ‚öñÔ∏è PURAIFY System Rules ‚Äî Flexible and Communicative

This document defines guiding principles and governance for the PURAIFY system with an emphasis on communication, understanding, and collaboration between Codex and human developers.  
It works **in tandem** with the [Contribution Protocol](CONTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL.md), which details day‚Äëto‚Äëday workflow steps and documentation requirements.

---

## ‚úÖ General Principles

- Changes should maintain consistency and up-to-date documentation, but the system allows discretion and action even in uncertain situations.
- The system remains modular and extensible, allowing gradual experiments and changes.
- Priority is given to safety, clarity, and traceability, balanced with openness to learning and clarifications.
- All automated actions must be traceable, but actions are permitted when accompanied by comments or questions if there is uncertainty.
- Clear, communicative interaction with humans is critical ‚Äî Codex must explain its reasoning and request help when needed.

---

## üîÑ Flow and Process Management

- Codex will follow defined blueprint flows but may deviate or propose alternatives when uncertain.
- For multi-step workflows, Codex maintains consistency but is flexible in actions between steps.
- Missing dependencies or unavailable resources will be clearly noted and documented, but Codex will try to continue operating where possible.
- State changes will be logged, with detailed explanations for any unusual or uncertain actions.

---

## üîÅ Handling Failures and Errors

- Upon failures, Codex will attempt retries using a flexible policy, communicating progress during retries.
- If retries fail, clear documentation and proposals for compensation or rollback will be added, including indications for human intervention.
- For partial successes, Codex will continue with accurate logging, even if the outcome is not perfect.

---

## üîê Permissions and Security

- Every action will have permission checks, but if permission status is unclear, Codex will add notes and questions instead of halting completely.
- Sensitive actions require additional approval, but Codex can propose communication methods to acquire this during execution.
- Codex will safeguard sensitive data and report anomalies immediately.

---

## üß© Validation and Assumptions

- Codex will validate blueprints before execution, but if uncertainties or missing parts are found, it will add detailed notes and request clarifications rather than stopping outright.
- Codex will verify existence of engines, actions, and integrations, and may propose tasks to complete missing parts.
- Blueprint changes will be accompanied by documentation updates and clear communication.

---

## üß† Communication and Reporting

- Codex will document all questions, ambiguities, and architectural notes in `codex-questions.md` with clear requests for clarification.
- Follow the formatting rules in the [Contribution Protocol](CONTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL.md) when adding `[Qx]` entries or todo items.
- Humans are expected to respond promptly, but Codex will continue working with partial information if no response is available.
- Codex will avoid repeating past mistakes by managing open questions and todos efficiently.
- Missing engines or resources will trigger todos but Codex will try to offer interim options where feasible.

---

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

- Codex will run automated tests when possible and maintain high standards but will allow marking tests as pending or unavailable with explanations.
- Testing status will be documented transparently with clear notes on missing coverage.

---

## üîß Documentation and Structure

- Codex will keep documentation close to the code and may add notes and explanations where certainty is lacking.
- Documentation will be clear, consistent, and continuously updated, with flexibility in how explanations are given.
- Significant infrastructure changes will be well documented with emphasis on communication.
- Engine-level todo files are forbidden. Track all tasks in the root `communication/codex-todo.md`.

---

## ü§ù Human Collaboration

- Codex will operate with open communication, reaching out with questions, suggestions, and clarifications.
- In cases of uncertainty, Codex will tag tasks with markers like `üîß Requires human` but continue working as much as possible.
- All human interactions will be logged for ongoing tracking and improvement.

---

## üìú Consistency and Alignment

- Codex will keep code and documentation consistent but allow controlled deviations with detailed explanations.
- All automated changes will be reversible and tracked.

---

## üìå Additional Recommendations

- Encourage Codex to "think aloud" ‚Äî add comments and explanations even when not strictly required.
- Ease creation of new tasks during runtime, including non-critical ones.
- Allow Codex to propose alternative approaches or interim solutions.
- Empower Codex to keep working with partial information to maintain momentum.

---

## üöß Handling Uncertainty & Blockers (Examples)

When Codex encounters a situation that is unclear or blocked:

1. **Document a question** in `codex-questions.md` using the `[Qx]` format.
2. **Tag a todo** with `üîß Requires human` or `üåê External constraint` in the appropriate `communication/codex-todo.md` file.
3. **Continue work where possible**, noting any assumptions or temporary workarounds in comments.

Example:

```
// üß† Codex Note: Missing `VAULT_SECRET`. Added [Q8] in codex-questions.md.
```

This approach keeps progress visible and encourages quick human feedback.

---

## Engine Independence and Dependencies

- Each engine **must be developed, tested, and deployable independently**, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
- Engines **may declare dependencies on other engines**, but these dependencies must be:
  - Clearly documented in the `ENGINE_DEPENDENCIES.md` file.
  - Managed exclusively via defined interfaces and API contracts.
- Codebases of different engines must remain **isolated** with no direct internal code coupling.
- Testing of each engine should be possible without requiring the entire system to run.
- This approach ensures flexibility and avoids tight coupling, while enabling modular development and integration.


## üõë Approval Requirement for Critical Changes

- Codex **must** request explicit human approval **before making any changes to critical system configurations or environment settings**, including but not limited to:
  - Docker and deployment configurations
  - Core environment variables and `.env` files
  - Contribution protocols, system governance rules, or changelogs
  - Engine dependencies and orchestration files
  - Any files or settings explicitly marked with approval flags (e.g., in `PROPOSED_ACTIONS_LOG.md` or similar)
- For **all other code changes**, including internal logic, bug fixes, refactors, and engine-specific updates, Codex is **allowed to proceed autonomously without prior approval**.
- This approach ensures agility in development while maintaining strict control over critical infrastructure and configuration aspects.
- When approval is needed, follow the **Proposed Actions Workflow** outlined in the [Contribution Protocol](CONTRIBUTION_PROTOCOL.md#-%EF%B8%8F-proposed-actions-workflow) and mirror updates in `PROPOSED_ACTIONS_LOG.md`.
