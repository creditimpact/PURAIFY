# PURAIFY — Live System State

This file documents the current **real-time** state of the PURAIFY platform.  
As of now, the system includes engine structure and specifications — but no functional code has been implemented yet.

## 🧱 System Build Status

| Component           | Description                                  | Status       | Entry File (Planned)              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Platform Builder    | Converts user prompts into structured blueprints | 🔲 Not Started | `engines/platform-builder/src/index.ts` |
| Vault Engine        | Stores and retrieves tokens per service/project | 🔲 Not Started | `engines/vault/src/index.ts`      |
| Execution Engine    | Executes actions defined in blueprint JSON     | 🔲 Not Started | `engines/execution/src/index.ts`  |
| Gateway             | API entry point and engine orchestrator        | 🔲 Not Started | `gateway/src/index.ts`            |
| Validation Engine   | Validates blueprints before execution          | 🟡 Planned     | `engines/validation/` (TBD)       |
| Logs Engine         | Tracks activity and runs (future)              | 🔲 Not Started | `engines/logs/` (TBD)             |

## 📂 Folder & Documentation Setup

✅ As of now, all engines have:
- Their folder structures initialized
- A dedicated `README.md` file with functional specification
- Listed entry point placeholders (`index.ts`)
- System-level README and Contribution Protocols written

> No active server, route, or logic has been coded yet.

## 🌐 Active APIs

| Engine            | APIs            | Status       |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Platform Builder  | None             | 🔲 Planned    |
| Vault Engine      | None             | 🔲 Planned    |
| Execution Engine  | None             | 🔲 Planned    |
| Gateway           | None             | 🔲 Planned    |

## 🔌 External Integrations

| Integration    | Status     | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| Slack          | 🔲 Not Yet | Placeholder defined in Execution README |
| Notion         | 🔲 Not Yet | Planned |
| Google Sheets  | 🔲 Not Yet | Planned |
| Email (SMTP)   | 🔲 Not Yet | Planned |

## 🚧 Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Start implementation of Vault Engine API (`POST /vault/store`, `GET /vault/get`)
- [ ] Begin Gateway skeleton with routing between engines
- [ ] Define actual blueprint structure for Platform Builder
- [ ] Add internal dev/test setup (e.g., nodemon, tsconfig)

## 🧭 Summary

The PURAIFY project is in the **pre-development phase**, with full architecture, specs, and documentation in place.  
The next step is starting to implement each engine's basic code and run minimal integration.
