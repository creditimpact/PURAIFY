# PURAIFY — Live System State

This file documents the current **real-time** state of the PURAIFY platform.  
As of now, most engines only contain scaffold code. The Vault Engine exposes a working `POST /vault/store` endpoint and plans to add `GET /vault/token/:project/:service`.

## 🧱 System Build Status

| Component           | Description                                  | Status       | Entry File (Planned)              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Platform Builder    | Converts user prompts into structured blueprints | 🟢 In Progress | `engines/platform-builder/src/index.ts` |
| Vault Engine        | Stores and retrieves tokens per service/project | 🟢 In Progress | `engines/vault/src/index.ts`      |
| Execution Engine    | Executes actions defined in blueprint JSON     | 🟢 In Progress | `engines/execution/src/index.ts`  |
| Gateway             | API entry point and engine orchestrator        | 🟢 In Progress | `gateway/src/index.ts`            |
| Validation Engine   | Validates blueprints before execution          | 🟡 Planned     | `engines/validation/` (TBD)       |
| Logs Engine         | Tracks activity and runs (future)              | 🔲 Not Started | `engines/logs/` (TBD)             |

## 📂 Folder & Documentation Setup

✅ As of now, all engines have:
- Their folder structures initialized
- A dedicated `README.md` file with functional specification
- Listed entry point placeholders (`index.ts`)
- System-level README and Contribution Protocols written

> No active server, route, or logic has been coded yet.

## 🌐 Active APIs

| Engine            | APIs            | Status       |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Platform Builder  | `POST /builder/create` | 🟢 In Progress |
| Vault Engine      | `POST /vault/store`, `GET /vault/token/:project/:service` | 🟢 In Progress |
| Execution Engine  | `POST /execute` | 🟢 In Progress |
| Gateway           | `POST /gateway/build-platform`, `POST /gateway/execute-action`, `POST /gateway/store-token` | 🟢 In Progress |

## 🔌 External Integrations

| Integration    | Status     | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| Slack          | 🔲 Not Yet | Placeholder defined in Execution README |
| Notion         | 🔲 Not Yet | Planned |
| Google Sheets  | 🔲 Not Yet | Planned |
| Email (SMTP)   | 🔲 Not Yet | Planned |

## 🚧 Immediate Next Steps

- [x] Implemented `POST /vault/store` endpoint for Vault Engine
- [x] Add `GET /vault/token/:project/:service` endpoint
- [x] Begin Gateway skeleton with routing between engines
- [x] Define actual blueprint structure for Platform Builder (initial interface implemented)
- [x] Add internal dev/test setup (e.g., nodemon, tsconfig)

---
## 🔄 Next Integration Steps
- Add `/gateway/run-blueprint` route to orchestrate builder output and sequential execution.
- Execution Engine must fetch tokens from Vault via `GET /vault/token/:project/:service` when actions need credentials.
- Gateway orchestrates flow; Execution handles token retrieval; Vault serves tokens; Platform Builder supplies the blueprint.


## 🧠 Codex Notes Map
engines/vault/src/index.ts:
  Note: ✅ GET endpoint implemented; DELETE endpoint pending
engines/platform-builder/src/index.ts:
  Note: ✅ Basic builder server created, blueprint interface defined; validation pending
engines/execution/src/index.ts:
  Note: ✅ Action runner and /execute endpoint added; token fetching from Vault pending
gateway/src/index.ts:
  Note: ✅ Gateway routing implemented; blueprint orchestration pending
integration-design:
  Note: ❓ Should Gateway or Execution Engine fetch Vault tokens during action execution?

## 🧭 Summary

The PURAIFY project is in the **early development phase**, with initial endpoints implemented for each engine.
The next step is to expand features, add validation, and integrate across engines.
